# Clean Code Workshop
*Length: ~ 2,5 hours*

This module is split into five parts, and the course includes hands on coding, a lecture and presentations of the code you just made.

## Part 0: Plan, Goals and Motivation
*Length: 10 minutes*

Q: What do you associate with clean code?

## Part 1: Presentation
*Length: 30-45 minutes* 

- Story of a time I messed up (not writing clean code)
- Meaningful Names: Class, Functions and Variables
- Functions and Classes: Keep Them Small! *Should do one thing, explanatory names.*
- DRY KISS
- Comments and Documentation
- Formatting
- Error Handling
- TDD and Testing
- Consistency
- Code Smells: *Argumnents, dead code, duplication, information at the wrong level of abstraction, understand the algorithm, conventions, negative conditionals, don't be arbitrary, use datatypes*
- Example of Code Transformed From Bad Code To Clean Code

## Part 2: Improve the Code
*Length: 60 minutes* 

Use your knowledge and the piece of information you have just learned to tidy up the already working code. Maybe you found an error within the program?

[Rules for number to roman numerals and vice versa](https://www.toppr.com/guides/maths/knowing-our-numbers/roman-numerals/)


Choose one of the following:
- a) Identify errors and improve the code [presentation-code](https://github.com/fredrikmork/clean-code-workshop/blob/main/presentation-code/presentation-code/Program.cs) There is a [proposed-solution](https://github.com/fredrikmork/clean-code-workshop/blob/main/presentation-code/proposed-solution/Program.cs)
- b) Build them from scratch in your prefered language.

Pro tip: use this online compiler [online compiler](https://www.programiz.com/csharp-programming/online-compiler/)

## Part 3:
*Length: 20-30 minutes*
You can either choose option *a)* or option *b)*.

- a) -  Joint review, everyone presents how they cleansed their code with the presented principles.

- b) - Pair review, group up and present your solution to each other.

## Part 4: Conclusion and Discussion
*Length: 10 min*

What have we learned from this? In pairs; list 2 things you have learned and present them to the rest of the group.
